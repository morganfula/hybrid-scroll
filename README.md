# hybrid-scroll

In this project, I'm focusing on implementing both vertical and horizontal scrolling within a single webpage. To achieve this, I'll be utilizing the CSS sticky positioning attribute alongside Vanilla JavaScript. The aim is to create a dynamic and intuitive user experience, enhancing the overall functionality of the webpage.
